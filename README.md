What is ImposterCraft?
ImposterCraft brings thrilling deception, teamwork, and mystery into Minecraft! Inspired by popular social deduction games with an added twist, ImposterCraft pits a team of Crewmates against one or more Imposters in a fight for survival and trust. The twist? We have added new roles to the game enabling a more unique experience! Play as the bomber and blow up the crewmates, or become the engineer and vent as crew! Each round, players are assigned roles and tasked with completing objectives or eliminating foes without raising suspicion.
